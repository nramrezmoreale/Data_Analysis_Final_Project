# Data Analysis Final Project - EasyJet Market Expansion Analysis

## üìã Purpose of the Project
The goal of this project was to assist EasyJet, a multinational low-cost airline, in expanding its operations into Argentina's domestic flight market. Through advanced data analysis, we aimed to:
- Identify seasonal and monthly demand patterns.
- Detect peak days and times for interprovincial flights.
- Analyze air traffic between provinces to highlight high-volume destinations.

## üîë Key Insights/Findings
- **Seasonal Demand Trends:** Clear fluctuations in passenger demand across different seasons, aiding in capacity planning.
- **Peak Activity Periods:** Identification of peak days and times for flights, enabling optimized scheduling.
- **High-Traffic Provinces:** Highlighted provinces with the highest passenger volume to prioritize routes and focus marketing efforts.
- **Strategic Recommendations:** Suggestions to optimize pricing, scheduling, and route selection for increased market competitiveness and customer satisfaction.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Methods Used
### **Data Processing**

- **Data Cleaning:** Standardized column names, resolved null values, and ensured temporal consistency (UTC to UTC-3).
- **Transformation:** Combined datasets from 2019‚Äì2023, applied filtering for regular flights, and focused on flights with passenger data > 0.

### **Data Visualization**
- **Tableau Dashboard:** Interactive dashboard provided insights into demand trends, peak periods, and province-level traffic, enabling strategic decision-making. You can view the dashboard here:
